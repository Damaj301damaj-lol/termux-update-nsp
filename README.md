# Misconception 
A Misconception happened in the skyline discord server :p, just wanted to say that this is a rewrite of [ this script](https://gist.github.com/Vixeliz/62bdbfa081a7716c3b71b30c101f2912), and not a rewrite of the patching script, patching script is literally the same, just this download script is made with error checking and is less likely to fail then the older script
